# Trust as a Core Element of Social Capital in Health Research

## 1. Overview

Trust is a central component of cognitive social capital.  
In public health, it reflects the belief that others in the community will behave in ways that are fair, reliable, and supportive.  
Trust facilitates cooperation, reduces uncertainty, and promotes community participation.

Types of trust often considered in health-related research:

- **Generalized trust**: Trust in people in general (“Most people can be trusted”)  
- **Institutional trust**: Trust in institutions or public services (e.g., health system, government)  
- **Interpersonal trust**: Trust in family, friends, or close contacts

## 2. Trust in This Study

This study focuses on **generalized trust**, measured through CHIS items such as:

- “Do you think most people can be trusted?”  
- “Do you believe people are generally fair?”  
- “Would people help you if you were in trouble?”

These indicators are used to evaluate how personal beliefs in social reciprocity influence sustained program participation (≥2 times).

| Trust Dimension       | CHIS Variable Example            | Interpretation |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|
| Generalized trust      | “Most people can be trusted”     | Cognitive belief about social reliability |
| Perceived fairness     | “People are generally fair”      | Value-based perception of others’ behavior |
| Anticipated reciprocity| “People will help when in need” | Expected social support in communities |

## 3. Role of Trust in Participation

- Trust may **lower psychological barriers** to joining or continuing in health programs  
- Higher trust is associated with **greater perceived safety**, **interpersonal support**, and **social motivation**  
- In this study, higher trust scores are hypothesized to be **positively associated with participation ≥2 times**

## 5. Next Steps

- Confirm trust variables in CHIS and label appropriately in `01_preprocessing.ipynb`  
- Track SHAP values associated with trust indicators  
- Use this theoretical framing to explain differences in participation between risk groups
