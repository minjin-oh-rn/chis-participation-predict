# Theoretical Foundations of the Predictive Model

This project is guided by two primary theoretical frameworks: the Donabedian Model for evaluating health care quality, and Social Capital Theory for understanding interpersonal trust and support. These frameworks inform both variable selection and interpretation.

## 1. Donabedian Model

### Overview
The Donabedian Model evaluates quality of care by analyzing three components:

- **Structure**: System-level factors (e.g., access, insurance, infrastructure)
- **Process**: Interactions in care delivery (not modeled directly here)
- **Outcome**: Results such as behavior, participation, health status

### Application to This Study

| Variable                  | Donabedian Element |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Access score             | Structure           |
| Insurance coverage       | Structure           |
| Participation frequency  | Outcome             |

## 2. Social Capital Theory

### Overview
Social capital represents the resources embedded in social networks, including trust, norms, and support. It is commonly divided into:

- **Cognitive**: Trust, shared values, perceived fairness
- **Structural**: Participation, social networks, resource access

### Application to This Study

| Variable                    | Social Capital Element |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Trust in others or providers | Cognitive trust         |
| Informal support availability | Structural support     |
| Community involvement level | Structural capital      |

## 3. Role of Trust

Trust is conceptualized as a key determinant of ongoing health behavior engagement. In this model:

- **Low trust** may reflect social isolation or prior negative experiences
- **High trust** is associated with increased likelihood of continued participation

SHAP analysis confirmed that trust-related variables were among the top predictors of program continuity.
