# Donabedian Model of Health Care Quality

## 1. Overview  
The Donabedian model is a conceptual framework for examining health care quality.  
Originally proposed by Avedis Donabedian in 1966 and elaborated in later works, it breaks down quality into three interrelated components:

1. **Structure**: The settings, resources, and organizational features through which care is delivered (e.g., insurance coverage, provider availability, system access).  
2. **Process**: The actual delivery of care (e.g., health education, counseling, diagnosis).  
3. **Outcome**: The effects of care on health status, patient satisfaction, or behavior (e.g., improved health, continued engagement).

## 2. Application in This Study  

In this study, the Donabedian model informs how we interpret predictors of sustained participation in community health programs.

| Component  | CHIS Variable Examples              | Description |
|------------|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| Structure  | Insurance status, access to care    | External conditions enabling or limiting care engagement |
| Process    | Preventive screening, provider visits | Health system's direct interaction with individuals |
| Outcome    | Number of participations (≥2 times) | Behavioral result reflecting continuity in care |

**Participation (≥2 times)** is treated as a behavioral outcome, influenced by structural and process factors.

## 3. Why This Model Matters  

- Offers a system-level explanation of participation behavior  
- Matches well with population-level data like CHIS  
- Supports integration with Social Capital theory (structure overlaps with external social conditions)

## 5. Next Steps  
- Align SHAP variables with model components  
- Use this model to frame the interpretation of high/low risk group differences in `results/risk_group_summary.md`
