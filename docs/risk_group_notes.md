# Interpretation of Risk Groups

## Summary
This analysis used logistic regression and SHAP values to identify predictors of sustained participation (â‰¥2 times) in community health programs. The model highlighted key structural and psychosocial factors that distinguish high-risk participants from those who are likely to continue.

## High-Risk Groups
Based on SHAP values and subgroup patterns, the following groups were identified as at higher risk for early dropout:

- Individuals with low access scores (lowest 25%)
- Participants who report low trust in community or providers
- Older adults who are uninsured and report low perceived social support

## Implication
These findings suggest that tailored outreach strategies, community trust-building, and social navigation programs may improve retention in community health interventions. Risk group profiling can guide targeting in public health nursing and inform allocation of community resources.
