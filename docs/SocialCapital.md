# Social Capital Theory in Public Health

## 1. Overview

Social capital refers to the resources and benefits embedded in social networks, norms of reciprocity, and trust.  
It is a central concept in public health research, especially in understanding how social structures influence health behaviors and outcomes.

There are two widely recognized dimensions of social capital:

- **Structural social capital**: Actual networks and participation in community or organizational life  
  → e.g., civic engagement, group membership, volunteering

- **Cognitive social capital**: Shared values, norms, and trust among individuals  
  → e.g., trust in others, perceived fairness, social cohesion

These two forms interact to influence individuals’ access to social support, information, and participation.

## 2. Application in This Study

This study applies social capital theory to examine how trust and community connectedness influence continued participation (≥2 times) in community health programs.

| Type                      | CHIS Variable Examples          | Description |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Cognitive social capital  | Trust in people, perceived fairness | Reflects individual-level belief in mutual support and reciprocity |
| Structural social capital | Group participation, social activity | Represents network ties and active engagement with others |

These variables are used as predictors of sustained program participation in the machine learning model.

## 3. Why This Theory Matters

- Offers a framework to link **community trust and participation behavior**
- Bridges individual-level predictors (e.g., trust) with broader community-level dynamics
- Aligns with health promotion and behavioral participation models

## 5. Next Steps

- Use SHAP analysis to examine the relative contribution of trust-related variables  
- Discuss results in connection with both structural and cognitive social capital dimensions  
- Integrate with Donabedian’s structural component to explain participation outcomes
